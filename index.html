        <p>As many of you know, ProtonMail came under sustained DDOS attack
        starting on November 3rd, 2015. At the current moment, we are not under
        attack and have been able to restore services, but we may come under
        attack again.</p>
        <p>We are currently working with solution providers to find a way to
        mitigate this attack, however, it is quite unprecedented in size and
        scope so unfortunately finding a working solution is not easy. Because
        of the sophistication of this attack, we will also need to resort to
        quite expensive solutions which will burden our finances. It is for
        this reason that we are also collecting donations for a ProtonMail
        defense fund.</p>

        <p>ProtonMail was originally created to provide privacy to activists,
        journalists, whistleblowers, and other at risk groups, and we have many
        of those people in the ProtonMail community. Unfortunately, there are
        groups out there determined to oppose this which has led to this
        incident. However, we are confident that with your support, we can
        overcome this attack and come back stronger than ever, and continue to
        provide a place where online privacy is protected.</p>
        <p>As we will detail below, this attack has grown beyond just
        ProtonMail and is a full fledged cyberattack. We have been working with
        the Swiss Governmental Computer Emergency Response Team (GovCERT), the
        Cybercrime Coordination Unit Switzerland (CYCO), as part of an ongoing
        criminal investigation being conducted here in Switzerland and with the
        assistance of Europol. After much consultation, we have decided to
        release details about the full extent of the attack on us so the
        broader security and privacy community can stay informed.</p>
        <p>Slightly before midnight on November 3rd, 2015, we received a
        blackmail email from a group of criminals who have been responsible for
        a string of DDOS attacks which have happened across Switzerland in the
        <a href=
        "http://www.govcert.admin.ch/blog/14/armada-collective-blackmails-swiss-hosting-providers"
        target="_blank">past few weeks</a>.</p>
        <p>This threat was followed by a DDOS attack which took us offline for
        approximately 15 minutes. We did not receive the next attack until
        approximately 11AM the next morning. At this point, our datacenter and
        their upstream provider began to take steps to mitigate the attack.
        However, within the span of a few hours, the attacks began to take on
        an unprecedented level of sophistication.</p>
        <p>At around 2PM, the attackers began directly attacking the
        infrastructure of our upstream providers and the datacenter itself. The
        coordinated assault on our ISP exceeded 100Gbps and attacked not only
        the datacenter, but also routers in Zurich, Frankfurt, and other
        locations where our ISP has nodes. This coordinated assault on key
        infrastructure eventually managed to bring down both the datacenter and
        the ISP, which impacted hundreds of other companies, not just
        ProtonMail.</p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s1">At this point, we were placed under a
        lot of pressure by third parties to just pay the ransom, which we
        grudgingly agreed to do at 3:30PM Geneva time to the bitcoin address
        <strong>1FxHcZzW3z9NRSUnQ9Pcp58ddYaSuN1T2y</strong>. This was a
        collective decision taken by all impacted companies, and while we
        disagree with it, we nevertheless respected it taking into the
        consideration the hundreds of thousands of Swiss Francs in damages
        suffered by other companies caught up in the attack against us. We
        hoped that by paying, we could spare the other companies impacted by
        the attack against us, but the attacks continued nevertheless. This was
        clearly a wrong decision so let us be clear to all future attackers
        &#8211; ProtonMail will NEVER pay another ransom.</span></p>
        <p>Through MELANI (a division of the Swiss federal government), we
        exchanged information with other companies who have also been attacked
        and made a few discoveries. First, the attack against ProtonMail can be
        divided into two stages. The first stage is the volumetric attack which
        was targeting just our IP addresses. The second stage is the more
        complex attack which targeted weak points in the infrastructure of our
        ISPs. This second phase has not been observed in any other recent
        attacks on Swiss companies and was technically much more sophisticated.
        This means that ProtonMail is likely under attack by two separate
        groups, with the second attackers exhibiting capabilities more commonly
        possessed by state-sponsored actors. It also shows that the second
        attackers were not afraid of causing massive collateral damage in order
        to get at us.</p>
        <p>At present, ProtonMail&#8217;s infrastructure is still vulnerable to
        attacks of this magnitude, but we have a comprehensive long term
        solution which is already being implemented. Protecting against a
        highly sophisticated attack like the second one which was launched
        against us requires sophisticated solutions as we also need to protect
        our datacenter and upstream providers. Cost estimates for these
        solutions are around $100,000 per year since there are few service
        providers able to fight off an attack of this size and sophistication.
        These solutions are expensive and take time to implement, but they will
        be necessary because it is clear that online privacy has powerful
        opponents. In order to cover these costs, we are collecting donations
        for a ProtonMail defense fund, which can be found here:</p>

        <p>We are fighting not just for privacy, but for the future of the
        internet. We would especially like to thank the thousands of users who
        offered their support and encouragement on Twitter and Facebook, we
        will never stop fighting for you. Over the next several weeks, we will
        begin putting in place the sophisticated protections that are necessary
        to withstand large scale attacks like this to ensure that online
        privacy can&#8217;t be taken down.</p>
